# SmartKnB

Abstract: The amount of data available in the modern Electric Arc Furnace operation, even if only using standard instrumentation and automation, has proven to have enormous potential for process analysis and improvement using the latest Artificial Intelligence tools and algorithms, as they have been implemented on a dedicated software recently developed by AMI, the SmartKnB platform.

SmartKnB is a graphic programming interface making possible to develop solutions merging data acquisition, complex process logic and machine learning models, all in the same user-friendly environment. Several applications have been developed and deployed in the field of EAF using the SmartKnB, for instance, to follow the process from the raw material intake, analyzing its characteristics in advance to optimize the melting and final steel composition. Also, capable of continuously evaluating correlations between the process and usage of consumables to find the most favorable operating point. Finally, a scrap type classification based on image has also been implemented using a Convolutional Neural Network model in the software. The possibility of adding image processing and using advanced cameras capable of withstanding the harsh environment of a steel plant, will give immediate feedback to the AMI platform, opening a vast field of opportunities to put eyes on the process closer than ever.
